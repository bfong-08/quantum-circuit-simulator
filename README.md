# Quantum Teleportation Protocol with NumPy

Quantum teleportation allows the transfer of an unknown quantum state from one location to another using **entanglement** and **classical communication** without physically sending the qubit itself. This process is important because it is a reliable way to transmit quantum data securely and accurately without measuring the quantum state or violating the **no-cloning theorem.** Quantum teleportation is essential for building quantum networks, distributed quantum computers, and the quantum internet.

My goal is to simulate the quantum teleportation protocol with Python and NumPy in order to explore how information is transferred via entanglement and classical communication. I will model qubit states, entanglement, measurements, and quantum gates. Simulating this process allows me to study quantum behavior without needing real quantum hardware, since I don't have access to any.
